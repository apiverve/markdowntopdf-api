## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  "markdown": "# Sample Document\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a sample markdown document that will be converted to PDF.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **First point**: This is important\n- **Second point**: This is also important\n- *Third point*: Don't forget this\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for using our API!"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  "markdown": "# Sample Document\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a sample markdown document that will be converted to PDF.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **First point**: This is important\n- **Second point**: This is also important\n- *Third point*: Don't forget this\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for using our API!"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  "markdown": "# Sample Document\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a sample markdown document that will be converted to PDF.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **First point**: This is important\n- **Second point**: This is also important\n- *Third point*: Don't forget this\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for using our API!"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```
